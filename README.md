# Inspiration
As engineering students, content is abundant and time is limited. Often we get up from a study session, but just don't understand where the time went by. After reading Deep Work by Cal Newport and researching and reading ways to improve productivity, we discovered something. Our focus is like a flame, very delicate yet very powerful when concentrated. The smallest distraction can lead us on a whole new tangent of irrelevant videos, throwing water on our delicate flame of focus while also just wasting time.

# What it does
Introducing Deep Focus. A Google Chrome extension that can preserve your focus, and get you back on track. Most commonly we don't actively seek distraction but are accidentally drawn to it and taken away. One reminder is all it takes to remind us what we're really sitting down to do and put us back on track - into a zone of Deep Focus.

# How we built it
CSS, Javascript, HTML + Chrome Browser

# Challenges we ran into
We found that there were many limitations to Chrome Extensions, such as the inability to execute inline JS functions due to Google's Content Security Policy. This led to the use of alternative methods when coding. 

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We created a Chrome extension for the first time and created a functional feature. 

# What we learned
As a team, we learned how to create and modify a Chrome. We also were able to enhance our skills in Javascript. In addition, we also learned the basics of JSON files. 

# What's next for Deep Focus
Implementing more features and improving the user interface for a more comprehensive experience for our users. Some features we plan on including are the ability to block sites with irrelevant info.
